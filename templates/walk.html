            <!-- Description of Walking Benefits -->
            Walking is a really good form of exercise and can help you reach your fitness and weight-loss goals.
            Explore your environment on foot. Notice what is going on around you and you'll find you never really walk the same way twice. There are always new things to see.
            Find pleasant places to walk. Look for walking paths, greenways, and pedestrian streets to enjoy.
            Bring along your family and friends. Walking together is a great way to connect with others.
            Walk instead of drive for a few trips each week. Walk part of your commute to work or school. Leave the car behind or get off a stop early on public transit. Walk to the store for small items. You'll save money and have a purpose for getting in your daily steps.
            Try a charity walk to raise money for a cause. Put your steps to good use.
